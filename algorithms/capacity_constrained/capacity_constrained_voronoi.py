Capacity-Constrained Voronoi Tessellation Algorithm - Exact Paper Implementation.

This module implements Algorithm 1 from the paper:
"Capacity-Constrained Point Distributions: A Variant of Lloyd's Method"
by Michael Balzer, Thomas Schlömer, and Oliver Deussen

This is the exact algorithm as described in the paper, using heap data structures
for efficient point assignment and capacity constraint enforcement.

The algorithm maintains a power tessellation T : X → S that fulfills the 
capacity constraint C with Σ C(s) = 1.
