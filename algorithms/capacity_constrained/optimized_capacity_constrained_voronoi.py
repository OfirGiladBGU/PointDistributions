Optimized Capacity-Constrained Voronoi Tessellation Algorithm.

This module provides an optimized version of Algorithm 1 from the paper:
"Capacity-Constrained Point Distributions: A Variant of Lloyd's Method"
by Michael Balzer, Thomas Schlömer, and Oliver Deussen

This optimized version maintains the same algorithmic principles but with significant
performance improvements for practical use while keeping the original for comparison.

Key optimizations:
- Reduced sample density for faster computation
- Efficient heap operations with batch updates
- Optimized capacity violation checking
- Smart convergence criteria
- Vectorized distance computations
